A JavaScript implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://web.stanford.edu/%7Ecdebs/GameOfLife/).

- represents the board as 2D array of cells
- creates a second representation of board as 2D array of number of live neighbors
- uses map, filter, and reduce for calculation/iteration

`index.html` displays a canvas version of the program, with play/pause and reload buttons. (Play/pause can be triggered with the `Space` or `Enter` keys. Reloading can be triggered with the `r` key.)

Also, can run on the terminal or in the browser console.
